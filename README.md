## Ajusting accesability for better quality searchability 
This project was practice and to deminstrate the value of semanitc elements so that the bad habit of over using <div> or <span> didnt becomin instilled.

I engaged with this project in order to better my understanding of the veriaty of semantic elements and how to clean up a pre built project with out changing the quality of its output.

what i learned durring this project is, that good comments can be difficult when adding them to someone ellses work, semanitc elements are strate forward but can have unintended effects on the finished outcome, and the ability to convay quality information through commenting the push and a developed readme file can go a long way.
